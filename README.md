# Project Title

Kata_QuizApp

## Working Functionality

Kata_QuizApp is "Option 1: Quiz" of the take home Kata. It is a web application written in HTML, JS, and CSS that fetches questions and answers from the Open Trivia Database. The app successfully takes a user through a quiz, keeps track of the user's score based on that quiz, and displays the score at the end of the quiz. The user earns points by getting a question right. However, the user loses points by getting a question wrong. Moreover, there is a working time limit, leaderboard, and ability to choose how many questions a user answers.

## Hardcoded Features and Noticeable Bugs

Kata_QuizApp has many hardcoded features, such as the Login feature on the front page. The Login feature allows the user to connect their username and store points gathered from quizzes. Additionally, a logged in user can explore the Quiz App Shop, also hardcoded, where the user can purchase boosts for future quizzes. Another feature that is hardcoded is displayed when the user starts a quiz. There is a row of numbers ranging from 1-5 with < and > on both ends. These numbers are meant to operate as a question selector, where the number of the question that the user is currently answering is bolded. Lastly, there are some noticeable bugs in the code. For instance, some questions and answers have extra characters in them. Another bug is the leaderboard, where an invalid username with an invalid amount of points may appear.

* This project took me roughly 7-8 hours to write, debug, and hardcode. I spent some extra time understanding APIs.

Kata_QuizApp was built following this tutorial. I have been exposed to API endpoints, TypeScript, React JS, etc. through previous internships. However, I never had the experience to work with APIs and write my own applications. Luckily, I found this tutorial, which came to be very useful in building the web application. The project in the video served as a strong foundation for the Kata_QuizApp. I wrote the code alongside the tutorial and implemented different features to incorporate a personal touch. I felt that this portrayed software development scenarios in the real world. The program from the tutorial and the Kata_QuizApp look very similar. This is due to the fact that my focus of the project was to work on my HTML and JS skills, not as much CSS. I did not have much time to dive into working with CSS.
